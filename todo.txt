* perhaps there needs to be a function to check for any universals that are out of scope.  I think placeholders are ok because they'll unify to something, but a universal out
  of scope can introduce a silent type failure.  There is a case for a single universal, but it should probably apply to all universals within the field type

* you have to disallow the situation where a function returns a type variable that doesn't appear elsewhere in the definition, but that is then cast to a concrete type.  This
  is a blind cast and is unsafe, but we're currently relying on it for memory allocations and such
* split AST and Expr pattern matching to make the expr stuff easier to use. The identifier and resolve patterns are kind of clunky and there's a syntax error in bindings which
  should be in refinery if possible
* do you need to test unification between class and parent class, as well as trait def and impl type?

* add some way of creating a traitobj using a def or annotation (issues with universals vs variables and mapping typevars; using check_type(..., false) works but might not be correct)

* should you make a trait object's data be the first pointer (always a pointer), so that a double deref will get it, rather than an indexed deref?
* should you use a different format for trait objects vs unbound universals?
* should you make it so that only functions/classes/enumdefs/etc can create a universal, and other places like new/definition/etc will raise an error if they are undefined, is this useful?
* should you have a check of class/enum type parameters to make sure they are Universals (or that they contain Universals), otherwise error since using a fixed typeparam is pointless

* for calling a function without it being a method call, you can parse "(" expression ")" into a special AST::BracketExpr or something, which can pass through the expr
  but can still be checked by the refinery and converted into an Expr::MethodInvoke or however you'll do that
* I'd really like to change the way method calls are done.  It's annoying having all these definitions and blocks for every call
  but this might not be possible because you need to bind references during type checking, and you can't do that without all the variants


* write overview
* implement trait dependence
* fix method invokes
* implement the record and tuple pattern matching


* should you make a generic type visitor?  could be used for bind_names, display, etc
* can you make closure conversion a separate stage somehow, possibly with a MutVisitor
* can you make an exception conversion mut visitor? to add the execption argument to everything
* can you put a validation stage in that can check for overloading at the end of type checking rather than during.  Trait impl checking can be moved there too
* can you remove some of the weirder ref trails (a ref to a ref to a ref), to make things simpler and more predictable? overload variants, enum variants, and traits use them
* you can maybe store more info in the defs, including the context of the function (Plain, Class Method, Trait Method), and then use that during transform
* add common constants for various context and vtable strings throughout, instead of dupilcating strings
* add a check to make sure trait defs are all ABI::Molten
* reduce the number of clone()s
* for transformer, you could have a list of 'bodies' of code, which are appended to by the transform functions, rather than returned.
  It could also store the context, but you'd have to add a body when transforming `if`, `while`, `sideeffect`, `match`, `try`, and `import`
* move the pattern transform functions into the visitor, but right now you're passing in a value_id to use for comparisons.  It'd have to be stored in the transformer obj insteado
* for Expr resolve and accessor, the oid's could maybe be integrated into the ident? same for invoke now?  well now traits are using oid for a ref...



METHODS DISCUSSION:

* make it possible to implement methods on enums
* you know... it might be possible to make all 'methods' actually be functions with a fixed type for the first argument, since functions can be overloaded, and the
  type would be unique.  I guess it wouldn't work for inheritence, but at least it doesn't cause this weird irregularity between classes/objects and enums (and eventually traits and trait objects)
* you need to figure out what should and shouldn't be a reference type... objects are always references that are malloced with 'new', and only objects can use 'new',
  whereas enums, records and tuples are not reference types, but can be made into references with 'ref'.  There will also be trait objects.  Enums are already 'Type::Object'
  and are distinguished by their definition, yet one a reference always and the other is not.  Trait objects would implicitly always be a reference

* currently you have function overloading, and class method overloading, which are forms of ad-hoc polymorphism.  Should all function overloading instead require a trait
  implementation (eg. all the infix operator functions and str functions would become traits which would be implemented for different types instead of being overloaded funcs).
  Class methods kind of still need to be ad-hoc.
* if you made overloaded functions implement traits instead, then you'd want to be able to call them like functions, maybe sometimes also like methods (eg. str(x) and x.str())
* would you still be able overload function names and argument numbers?  You could have trait { add('a, 'a) } and also add(String, String, String), since the types of the functions
  don't overlap, but you couldn't also have add(Int, Int) which isn't defined as a trait impl, since it would conflict with add('a, 'a).  This might not be too different from what
  you have now, as long as you make sure to check trait def types when checking for overloading




* can you remove access to getindex, buffer, etc?
* if you had a way of indexing an object easily, given an llvm object, then you can fix the print() functions to take a SuperString (which would become String)
* You could have a mutable ByteArray type, which contains the length, or an immutable ByteString or ZByteString that can be passed to C functions, so that SuperString
  could have a ByteArray with the ability to index it (which would check the length), while a ZByteString would be unindexable (an opaque type)

* rename Buffer type to RawPointerArray, or GenericsArray, or BoxArray
* rename String type to ByteString, ByteArray, or CString, or ZString, or NullString, or NullByteArray, or ZByteArray, RawString;  I'm leaning ZByteArray or ByteString
* rename SuperString type to String, will require a bunch of libcore changes
* rename List to Array or Vec


* why is the global == and != not causing an overload error?  (I assume it's because over*riding* is enabled (global scope is different from module scope), but it's still a bit weird)
* will there be an issue where declaring a function that's external, but not via an import, might cause the global variable to be defined incorrectly??

* need a way to import/compile directory of many files (libcore as many files)
* add a module keyword which is automatically inserted into .dec files, which actually calls the run function, including the canonical name/path when the module was compiled
* remove the forced visibility in refinery, when you decide on pub/priv semantics

* classes shouldn't require a new function if all data has initializers...
* make definitions always require an initializer
* there was an error where "let ni: newint" with no initializer was causing a type error with "expected class or concrete type", but that was actually because a definition without
  an initializer is the same as "let ni: newint = nil" and nil could not be cast to a Record, which newint is a typealias of a record

* should you make it possible to call a trait method via a resolve; eg. Add::add(x, y).  The issue is that vtable is in the objects

* iterators could be implemented as classes, traits implemented on something, or possibly closures?
* add namespace of some kind, such that you can group functions?  like 'module' from ML?? like impl from rust?? or like namespace from C
* there is an issue with raise, in that it is considered to return unit () instead of somehow being marked as not returning...  Getting type errors in Option def



BUGS:
* there's a possible issue with closure reference conversion, where you only check if the name exists in the global scope, but not if it's the same definition.  It's
  possible there could be a different variable with the same name declared in the global scope causing the local one to not be converted into a context access.  But
  right now, because of overloading, the def will be a specific function, and the stored scope def will be the overloaded def that contains all the possible specific impls
* the overload check seems to fail in test.mol lines 94/111 with foo2 in Stuff because of the new overload code.  It's giving an overload error unless foo2 which takes a
  single Real is commented out.  It's because the types are added during the name binding phase.  This needs to be added as a test case
* the infer-arg-as-typevar test fails because str() cannot be resolved to a concrete variant by the time it's typechecked (no backwards affect allowed)
* there is still a bug with the Phi statement, in that it will return null if you don't cover all cases. there is no check for coverage
* issue with calling function references store in structs or tuples... it converts them to methods incorrectly
* unwrap error when recursively calling in `let recfoo = fn x =>` because the actual DefLocal is inserted after the initializer code is transformed, but if this was fixed,
  would it be possible to access recfoo before it's been initialized, such as in `let something: Int = { something; 0 }`
* parse error for if statements in an expression, they require brackets around them: let h = 5 + if r > 4 then 5 else 10



Error Messages:
* when a trait is not implemented, it will produce an unhelpful type error that it expected random variable, but found unimplemented type
* there is no context info for the ununified variables, which makes it hard to find the issue
* you can put a restriction on type aliases such that a type can only use type vars defined in the declaration
* you could require that classes explicitly define their type variables by name, to catch type errors.  So every method or definition in the top level of the class
  could only use explicitly declared type variables
* you might not be making sure that non-closure functions don't access variables outside their scope (methods are never closures)
* make sure that you don't overload different types of functions (closures, functions, and methods must all be the same type to allow overloading)
* should you make mutable modifiers more strict, like rust?



Refactoring:
* improve storing of file info in the Pos structs (maybe rename to Span?)
* change parser to take session argument or something so it can record the file info, and maybe do other advanced things





TESTS:
* test for static method vtable access, dynamic dispatch via that mechanism, and overloading used with resolve
* error conditions, lack of typing should error, etc
* test that non-closures accessing values outside their scope produces meaningful errors
* test that you don't allow overloading of overlapping function types, and different function types (??)
* test module system (might need a test opt-out for submodules in a test)




Changes:
* get hashmap in libcore working
* change how you reference an operator function; like op+ or (+)
* put intermediate files somewhere else, at least as controlled by the molten script, so as not to clutter source directories
* there's no way to genericly compare or print tuples or records (maybe memcmp based comparison)

* improve library path handling
* should it be possible to not import all symbols from a module?  Should there be a namespaced object thing?
* how does rust do "use" if there is a circular dependency?
* the module level scope is now a closed function, so you could return a representation of it as the "module" object

* you could modify the forloop code to take an iterator in future
* should vtables be dynamically allocated, or should we add a LLType::ElementOf() type or something to GetElement an aliased type

* the following issues are solved by traits, but the haven't been modified to use traits yet
* strings, buffers, and all the builtin types require vtables if they have methods, but there aren't vtables stored inside them.  You could make static vtable exceptions for them
* make builtin types unable to inherit from, because there's no vtable
* fix lib to allow builtin classes??

* can you make a check for nil before unboxing a type... and somehow return an appropriate default value?  I guess that's feasible because only builtin types would be
  boxed/unboxed, although records and tuples might be an issue



* add 'import as' syntax
* add 'decl as' syntax
* add pipe operator
* make loops use phi, and add break
* add compiler directives?






* should you remove the Nil type? (yes, but it'll be a bit tricky)
* should you fix scope resolution to also work on objects, so that you can have static methods from the object without explicitly referencing its type
* should exports also list all the modules that the file imports, so that class definitions in other imports can be found, if needed for arguments
* should you add break/continue statements for loops
* should you require that all return types be used, unless an "ignore('a)" function is explicitly used?
* should you add some means of accessing variant values without pattern matching?
* should you change Real to Float?  also should you change them to lower case names, which is in line with sml, ocmal, f#
* should you add access modifiers to classes, and maybe functions; public, private, protected
* should module init return something other than 0, like a module object?  Is that even useful?
* should you add a return statement?  It's not functional, but it's practial
* should you allow keyword arguments in invoke; foo(a=10, b=20)
* should you allow arguments with a default value to be omitted from a function call?, that would require a bunch of changes to typechecking
* should local variables be allowed to be mutable...
* should you require an override keyword when masking definitions in lower scopes? like class definitions
* should you add macros and expandable forms (like lisp)
* should you implement assignment of tuples and records? (in addition to the record update syntax)

* is it even possible to add a special "constrained" type, which has &AST that must type check correctly in order to match (checks done in check_type)
* what if you generalize overloaded types, such that they're checked in check_type, and options are eliminated, or resolved to one type over the course of checking
* should you implement the context method described in the proper bidirectional typechecker algorithm


EXAMPLE PROGRAM IDEAS:

* hash table
* regex matcher


NOT REALLY BUGS:

* mabye not a bug, but unable to define a method as / MF or / C ABI
* not really a bug, but if you only have one element in a tuple, or in a record, it parses it as a block or expression
* not really a bug, but empty lists cannot be typechecked to concrete types unless it's explicitly provided ("[]" on its own)


COMPLETED TESTS (for reference):

* test for references, records, tuples, used in local vars, func args, return values, etc
* test for directly calling functions in records or tuples, which shouldn't add the object argument
* test for records that have different member orders are still equal
* test that raise inside a C function causes a syntax error
* test class init with inherited classes
* test for recursive C functions, recursive MF functions
* parse error with let bar = ref { a = 1, b = 2 } \n (!x).a
